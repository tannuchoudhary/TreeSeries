# Postorder using iteration(using 2 stacks)


## Steps:
* Take 2 stack, st1 and st2
* Push root in st1
* pop the top element of st1 and push it in st2
* after pushing something in st2, find out if it has left and right, if it has then push the left and right in the st1
* now again pop the top element of stack and push it in st2, and find out if it has left and right, if it has then push the left and right in the st1
* continue this process until st1 will become empty

```cpp
//iterative - using two stacks

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> postorder;
        if(root == NULL) return postorder;
        
        stack<TreeNode*> st1, st2;
        
        st1.push(root);
        while(!st1.empty()){
            TreeNode* node = st1.top();
            st1.pop();
            st2.push(node);
            
            if(node->left) st1.push(node->left);
            if(node->right) st1.push(node->right);
        }
        
        while(!st2.empty()){
            postorder.push_back(st2.top()->val);
            st2.pop();
         }
        return postorder;
    }
};

# Postorder using iteration(using 1 stack)

## Steps
* create a stack
* Push all the left into the stack
* check if the top of the stack contains right
* if not then just push the top into postorder(answer)
    * if the pushed element was right of someone, and that right( i.e root of the current pushed element) is in top of the stack then push that into postorder, and do this until the temp is right of top of the stack, we are doin this because first we pushed left into the postorder then we are checking whether the pushed element was left or right, if it is right then now it is the turn of root to be pushed of

* if it contains right, then push all of them into the stack

basically, we are moving to the left and push it in asnwer only if it does not contains right, if contains right then push
